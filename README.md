<h1>Welcome to Poxedexu!</h1>
On Pokedexu, you can:
- Explore the pokedex in each of the Pok√©mon regions. National, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and many more!
- Find your beloved Pok√©mon in the search field.
- Get information about each Pok√©mon when you click on it. Starting from the type of pokemon, pokemon abilities, to the base stats of each Pok√©mon.

  
For now, here are the features that I can do. In the future maybe I will improve or add new features in this Pokedexu. Please advise me! üëçüëç
